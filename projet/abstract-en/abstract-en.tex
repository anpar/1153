In this course, \textit{Projet 2}, we have been asked to make a loudspeaker that can be connected to a smartphone with a Jack-plug.

To achieve this task, we had to work out to find a way to go through it.
We had to find mathematical and physical modele but the real problem was too tricky for us so we had to make some simpler assumptions.
However, we couldn't make random assumption because the theory had to fit with the test we did in the lab.

In this document, you'll find the necessary calculations and ideas to make such a tool. It also describes some
of our documentary researches.

Even if our loudspeaker doesn't work as well as we wanted, we learned a lot from this challenge. 

Our state of mind is pretty hard to describe: we are disappointed with the actual loudspeaker but quite proud of us for the rest.
