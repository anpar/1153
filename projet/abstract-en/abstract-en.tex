The loud-speaker is a tool that transforms an electric signal into a sound.  Thanks to a fixed coil,
a mobile one can oscillate and because it is attached to a membrane, it creates a sound wave.  
Many tests have been done to get a functional loud-speaker. 
We did mathematical calculations but we had to use hypothesises that are simpler than the reality.
So the only way to know if it works or not is to test it.
In this document, calculations and ideas could have done such a tool are present.  (cette phrase a-t-elle un sens?)
Our loud-speaker is able to produce a sound with a frequency between \SI{500}{\hertz} and \SI{5000}{\hertz}
and has a power of \SI{2.5}{\watt}.  We made the loud-speaker with a membrane of \SI{0.17}{\meter} of diameter,
a fixed coil of \numprint{450} spires and mobile one of \numprint{100} spires.  
With the jack plug ( a cable that can rely a Gsm of a smartphone) we can get a sound and moreover 
its intensity can be modified.
